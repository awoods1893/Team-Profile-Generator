  # Project Description
  Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

  # User Story
  AS A manager, I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

  # Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.
- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.
- WHEN I click on the GitHub username THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.
- WHEN I start the application THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.
- WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.
- WHEN I select the engineer option THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.
- WHEN I select the intern option THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.
